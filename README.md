# Emotion_Detector_NLP
Emotion_Detector_NLP is a machine learning project focused on classifying text into different emotional sentiments such as Positive, Negative, and Neutral. It leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques to process and analyze textual data efficiently.

## ðŸ’¡ Overview
This project demonstrates how to:
- Clean and preprocess text data
- Extract features using TF-IDF
- Train various classification models (Logistic Regression, SVM, etc.)
- Evaluate model performance
- Predict sentiment from user input text

## ðŸ§  Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK / SpaCy
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualization
- Jupyter Notebook

## ðŸ“¦ Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Emotion_Detector_NLP.git
cd Emotion_Detector_NLP
pip install -r requirements.txt

ðŸŽ¯ Features
Text cleaning: lowercasing, stopword removal, punctuation handling
Feature extraction with TF-IDF
Model training and evaluation
Confusion matrix and classification report
Real-time prediction with user input

ðŸ“Š Example
Input: "I loved the new update!"
Predicted Emotion: Positive

ðŸ“ˆ Model Performance
Accuracy: ~XX% (based on dataset)
Precision/Recall/F1 scores available in the notebook
Confusion Matrix for visual understanding

ðŸ“Œ Future Improvements
Use deep learning (e.g., LSTM or BERT)
Expand emotion categories (e.g., anger, joy, sadness, fear)
Web interface for live demo
